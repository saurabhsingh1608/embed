Manage your ThoughtSpot objects with the [__Verion Control APIs__](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rest-apiv2-reference#_version_control) and [__Github Actions__](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Quickstart

  1. __[Fork this repo](https://github.com/thoughtspot/ts-vcs-actions/fork)__.
  2. [__Configure your Org(s)__](info/config.md).
  3. [__Configure your GitHub Secrets__](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) to manage authenticatation to __ThoughtSpot__.

__ThoughtSpot__ [__requires an authenticated session__](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/api-authv2) in order to use the APIs. Each of the workflows will ask for 3 secrets.

  - `THOUGHTSPOT_URL` - your ThoughtSpot URL (eg. __https://company.thoughtspot.cloud__)

  As well as either one of ..

  - `THOUGHTSPOT_SECRET_KEY` - your cluster-level __ThoughtSpot__ [__secret key__](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/trusted-auth-secret-key)
